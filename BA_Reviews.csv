The worst service ever
Cannot recommend
BA is worse than a low cost carrier
less than a premium experience
"good, but not spectacular"
Lies and misleading unprofessional service
avoid BA like the plague
British Airways absolutely does not care
utter abdication of responsibility
express our displeasure and concerns
they are the worst in Europe
customer service being so horrible
appalling customer service
standards are worse than ever
still waiting for reimbursement
"unprofessional, uncaring"
"Nice flight, good crew, very good seat"
Such a horrible experience
"Never again, BA"
ravioli pasta had dried out
Great customer service
Cabin crew were all fantastic
asked us to check our bags
service is extremely poor
superior to mainline British Airways
Staff quite unpleasant
They lost my baggage
leaving two hours late
flight is delayed
Couldn't recommend BA more
bumped off due to overselling
a very comfortable flight
good onboard service
they have really gone downhill
lives in their past glory
Check-in Desk rude and dismissive
"All in all, terrible"
cancelled the rebooked flight
Zero empathy was shown
pilot apologise at every step of the way
crew were always ready to top up drinks
The service is really mediocre
made their economy experience so miserable
Customer Service does not exist
another great experience
Not recommended
5 hours and 30 mins but no meal
Things have really deteriorated
I will never fly this airline again
asked for an explanation but have received none
short-changing passengers
Economy is absolutely awful
Shocking customer service
no representative to help
Boarding was chaotic
In-line with competitors
Luggage are still in Glasgow
whole experience was terrible
preferred to fly on easyJet
stated it is not their fault
luggage was mis-tagged in Dallas
The airline lost my luggage
fully refunded by our travel insurance
no boarding drinks provided
WiFi didn't work
stick with economy
Communication is terrible
delays and cancellations
Economy class seating was truly dreadful
flight failed at every level
BA refuses to make it right
shame for such well known airline
Total garbage
arrived at the airport only 1 hour before
so callous and uncaring
uncomfy old planes
never fly British Airway ever again
Most uncomfortable flight
I will never fly British Airways again
All in all very disappointing
customer service was horrendous
All flights without exception were delayed
An excellent flight
luggage was still in London
worst experience in all my years of travel
The worst experience
haven’t received any reimbursement
the crew has helped me
check-in process was terrible
the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with
Service was good
Last time I will fly British Airways
cancel your flight without notice
flights changed with no cost
"Cheap, quick and efficient"
the worst major European airline
do not think the fare was worth the money
BA is on the skids downhill
Absolutely terrible experience
poor service and unhappy customers
just won't use them again
Another bad show
what an earth is going on at BA
I had to reschedule my flight
most appalling airline service
Customer service is shocking
Avoid this airline
a lot of actual lies being told
premium price for very average service
lack of customer service
Overall not a good airline
delayed and missed connecting flight
!not a good experience
 A very pleasant experience
It was a nightmare
Abysmal service
trained to give you the runaround
they only had one choice of meal
relentless BA cost cutting
I wouldn't recommend British Airways
Absolutely horrible experience
This is the worst airline
never fly British Airways again
seats were cramped and uncomfortable
I enjoyed my flight
found the food menu rather odd
cover 50% of my new luggage
the worst flight of my life
flight was pleasant enough
downright rude and abusive
disappointing staff
crew could not give a damn
a very solid experience
Service was impeccable
"Very poor service, very frustrating"
Generally poor
changed our prepaid seats
airline is going downhill rapidly
"made a complaint, nothing happened"
Every flight was delayed
how far the quality level has slid
worst cabin experience ever
Very impressive and efficient
We are done with BA
I was left stranded at the airport
I will never fly with them again
A catalogue of failures
it's by no measure good
Avoid unless you have no other option
pathetically inefficient
fallen far behind their competitors
one of the worst experiences
a horror show of incompetence
My baggage never arrived
"Total disruption, wasted time"
what an absolute nightmare
I detest British Airways
"Clean aircraft, good crew, professional"
this airline is horrible
avoid flying British Airways
had better treatment from Ryanair
Would happily fly them again
one drink service on 10 hour flight
squashed into regular seats
nice and professional crew
"acceptable experience, nothing more"
FA's were very friendly
original flight was cancelled
no better than a low cost airline
they could not serve hot drinks
got virtually free tickets
found the attitude appalling
crew were really nice
Lots of cancellations and delays
"Overall, very happy with BA"
the best airline I've flown with
so determined to help
crew are a credit to BA
catalogue of errors and inconveniences
the food was poor
No more BA for me
Excellent service
Sound dinner service
A really excellent journey
flight was one of the worst
there is a race to the bottom
need to cancel the ticket and rebook
very friendly cabin crew
a good drinks and food service
you should let me use the lounge
I find BA incredibly tacky
This flight was so disappointing
just an average airline
Luggage is delayed
the worst business class experience I've ever had
not recommended for business class
surprisingly a good product
Maybe the old charm will return soon
having to pay to reserve a specific seat
Upgrade was worth it
Disappointing meal
minimal communication from their team
felt misguided and misinformed
Flight perfectly on time
treat your customers like idiots
cancelled only 4 hours before take off
have to use other airlines now
my suitcase didn’t arrive with me
Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience
luggage was finally delivered on Thursday
improvements needed with their ground staff2
appallingly uncomfortable flights
Cabin crew very good
late and delayed
learned my lesson about late BA upgrades
No curtain between business and economy class
electronics are very poor
couldn't even order any food / drink
My bag never showed up
eventually make good on their promise
Extremely sub-par service
the service was excellent
I thoroughly enjoyed my flight
wouldn't let me check-in until 24 hours before
Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it
Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA
lounge was overcrowded and worn out
very uncomfortable trip
rate this just as a mediocre journey
baggage yet to be delivered after 5 weeks
misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip
zero faith in British Airways
under whelmed by the experience
about as abysmal as you can get
has returned to full service
this flight was quite good
no attempt to provide fresh or hot foo
A very positive experience
Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered
cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful
Very rude and unhelpful staff
cabin crew were very helping
All in all BA was just fine
recommend BA's new Club Class
Would recommend
"hit the  call button, no response for an hour"
"She was attentive, warm, friendly"
cramped single aisle aircraft
it was an OK experience
wait for cases at Heathrow T5
cabin crew are usually exceptional
I still found it underwhelming
At least the food tasted good
I will never travel BA again
Couldn’t fault anything
personnel was just magnificent
Should be more snacks on board
Crew were friendly
very short leg space
staff were no help and frankly rude
Flight was cancelled at the last minute
I have to write a positive review
review is for BA booking system
I will not be flying BA again
not been recompensed for our expenses
she went above and beyond
Hard working crew
Philippines Airlines require a 24 hr negative covid test
not worth the risk of travelling with BA
cancelled my return flight
staff were so friendly
amazing at her job
no food available for the 4 year old
We had a nice flight
2 suitcases lost in 2 flights
Some things just do not change at BA
I have not received my refund
has taken a nosedive in my opinion
A good flight overall
managed to lose my luggage
get us on a flight 5 days later
refund process is non responsive
Seat was very uncomfortable
let down by chaotic check-in and boarding
Crew were attentive and charming
become an absolute nightmare
wonderful BA representative
Overall a good flight
disappointed and angry
lack of practical assistance
they have no idea where our bags are
Limited TV and movie selections
seat reservation fees are non refundable
cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service
Overall not happy at all
do not allow free seat selection
Really not fair to just take our money!
Trying to call BA was a nightmare
flight was delayed over 6 hours
No respect with the customer!
